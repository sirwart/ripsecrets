## 0.1.3 (Not yet released)

- Added a new --strict-ignore option for pre-commit usage. When a pre-commit is
  invoked it includes a list of filenames. By default secrets will search
  referenced files regardless of the contents of .gitignore or .secretsignore.
  However in a pre-commit context this will cause files explicitly ignored by
  .secretsignore to be searched and the pre-commit to potentially fail. Using
  the --strict-ignore flag will cause the .secretsignore file to be respected
  even if the file is passed as an argument.
